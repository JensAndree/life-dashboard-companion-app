/**
 * Exact, small Health Connect data under the app's own package, for the tests that need it.
 *
 * Never with a clientRecordId: an own record that carries one is what Receive writes, and the
 * sync leaves those out on purpose (ResilientReadLogic.isReceiveWrite). Idempotent by deleting
 * instead: [AppStateRule] deletes the app's own records of every type written here before the
 * next test, and a delete can only ever touch the caller's own records.
 *
 * Times are relative to the phone's clock and always end in the past, since Health Connect
 * refuses records that end in the future.
